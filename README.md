# CS161

This repo is a collection of projects completed for CS161: Computer security at UC Berkeley in the spring of 2020. All projects were group projects and the files in this repo are the result of joint effort between myself and [Jared](https://github.com/jaredspickard). 

## Project 1

This project is primairly about exploiting low level memory vulnerabilities in a virtual machine image provided by the school. The actual project description can be found [here](https://cs161.org/assets/projects/1/project1-problems.pdf).

## Project 2

This was a design based project where we were tasked with designing a secure file storage system. It's a functionally programmed application that allows for a user to store a file on a file store that is not secure and fully accesable by an adversary. Out implementaaion allows the user several functions including sharing and revoking file access and efficently appending to a stored file. Full project description can be found [here](https://cs161.org/assets/projects/2/project2-spec.pdf).
